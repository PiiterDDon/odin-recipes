    <h1>Uncle Iroh's Jasmine Tea - Last Airbender</h1>
    <img src="../images/iroh_tea_animated.gif">
    <p>Uncle Iroh is known for his deep wisdom and love of tea, particularly jasmine tea.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 teaspoons loose-leaf jasmine tea (or 1 jasmine tea bag)</li>
        <li>Freshly boiled water (about 8 ounces or 240 ml)</li>
        <li>Honey or sugar (optional, to taste)</li>
        <li>A teapot or teacup with a lid</li>
        <li>A strainer (if using loose-leaf tea)</li>
        <li>A quiet and peaceful place to enjoy your tea, just as Uncle Iroh would prefer</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil the Water:</strong><br>Start by boiling fresh water. It's important to use water that has just
            been
            brought to a boil, as water
            that has been sitting for a while can affect the taste of the tea.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Teapot or Teacup:</strong><br>Pour a small amount of the freshly boiled water into your
            teapot or teacup and swirl it around to warm the vessel. Then, discard this water.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Jasmine Tea:</strong><br>If using loose-leaf tea, place the jasmine tea leaves into the
            teapot
            or teacup. If you're using a tea bag, simply add the tea bag to the vessel.</li>
        <li><strong>Infuse the Tea:</strong><br>Pour the remaining freshly boiled water over the jasmine tea leaves or
            tea bag. The water should be just
            below boiling point, ideally around 180°F (82°C) for jasmine tea. Too hot water can make the tea taste
            bitter. Cover the teapot or teacup with a lid or saucer and let the tea steep for about 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy:</strong><br>After steeping, remove the tea leaves or tea bag. If desired, sweeten your
            jasmine tea with honey or sugar, but keep it light to appreciate the delicate jasmine flavor. Uncle Iroh
            preferred his tea slightly sweet, so you can adjust the sweetness to your taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Sip Mindfully:</strong><br>Take your time to savor each sip of jasmine tea. Find a peaceful and
            quiet spot to enjoy your tea, just as Uncle Iroh would in the series.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Remember, the key to a great cup of jasmine tea is not rushing the process and allowing the tea to steep
        properly. The delicate floral aroma and calming properties of jasmine tea make it a perfect choice for
        relaxation, just as Uncle Iroh would recommend.</p>
